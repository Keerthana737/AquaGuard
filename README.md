# AQUAGUARD - IoT Smart Monitoring System for Agriculture & Aquaculture
This project presents an IoT based environmental monitoring system that tracks critical parameters and generates alerts when unsafe conditions occur.

# System Overview
Sensors collect environmental data which is processed by an ESP32 and sent to Adafruit IO cloud for visualization and alert generation.

# Data Flow
Sensors → ESP32 → WiFi → Adafruit IO → Dashboard → Alerts

# Features
1) Real time monitoring
2) Cloud dashboard visualization
3) Threshold based alert system

# Project Documentation
Detailed explanation including system architecture, data flow, alert logic, and sample output is available in the project presentation file:
